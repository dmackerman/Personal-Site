The [Diablo 3 Mobile Companion](http://d3companion.com/) application that [Stan Bershanskiy](http://twitter.com/stan229) and I wrote is now open source. You can view the code on Github here:

**[https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/d3-mobile-companion](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/d3-mobile-companion)**

The `master` branch is the iOS build, and the `android` branch is the Andoid build. Duh.

Please check it out if you are looking for an intro to Sencha Touch code structure, as well as some cool custom styling, custom view creation, and much more. Working on the app was really a pleasure - a labor of love if you will. We're hoping to get a lot of good feedback and some great pull requests for features that we haven't implemented yet. 

Of course the app is still available for download [on the iOS app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diablo-3-mobile-companion/id565829323?mt=8) as well as the [Google Play marketplace](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moduscreate.d3mobile&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5tb2R1c2NyZWF0ZS5kM21vYmlsZSJd).
