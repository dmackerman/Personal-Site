Yesterday I got my [glass-holes.com overflow](http://www.glass-holes.com/700-gph-Overflow-Box-Complete-Kit-gh700kit.htm) and [return kits](http://www.glass-holes.com/3-4-Inch-Loc-Line-Return-Kit-ghReturn75.htm) installed in my tank. Installation was fairly simple and straightforward - great instructions for the crew over at glass-holes. Seems like they run a pretty tight ship over there, and they have a sense of humor which is a good thing to see in a business every once in a while.

### The install

Drilling glass wasn't as bad as I tought it'd be. Turns out it's rather easy, it just takes longer than I thought it would. Took me a solid 5 minutes to drill each hole, keeping in mind you aren't supposed to put a lot of pressure on the glass to resist cracking. **Remember to put something to catch the glass puck on the other side of the tank you are drilling**! Having a quality drill in this department really pays dividends. Both the return and overflow kits included the appropriate hole saw and templates for drilling which really sped things up. 

Overall the pieces feel really solid. The acryllic for the overflow is thick and nicely put together. Same can be said for the return. Glass-holes included a piece of [enkanmat](https://www.google.com/search?q=enkamat&hl=en&tbo=u&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ei=J06-UJy_A_OE0QGq84DoBw&ved=0CEcQsAQ&biw=1088&bih=980) inside the overflow to reduce noise and the "crashing" of the water inside the box, which I thought was a nice touch.  

I opted to go for the flared nozzle for the return line, just because I think they look cooler and could spread the water flow a little wider. Considering I don't have any water in the tank, this is all speculation. 

### Issues I ran into

This issue was compltely my fault, but my bad planning placed the overflow box right underneath the center brace of the tank. Doing so didn't allow my hand to reach in and secure the nut inside the overflow box. I got around this by temporarily taping the nut to the box, and "screwing" the bulkhead into the nut to get it stared, versus the other way around.

My new stand is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday, but I'll be out of town. Thinking Thursday I should be able to go pick it up!
