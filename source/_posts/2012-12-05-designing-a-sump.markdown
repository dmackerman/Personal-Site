There are a lot of pre-fabricated sumps out there. Most of them are made out of acryllic, and seem to be priced in the $250+ range for something around 20 to 25 gallons of water volume. Most of them also have a section for a refugium, and some of them seem to be built specifically for use with a wet/dry filter/bioballs, or something else that I'm not particularly interested in doing in my tank.

So I thought, why can't I just make something myself?

Literally, all a sump consists of is a tank with pieces of glass silicone'd in to make baffles. Of course [you can go much more intense](http://www.melevsreef.com/280g/280g_sump.html), but at the end of the day it's still fairly simple. It's *really* not much more than that. Why would someone pay $300 for a piece of acryllic when you can buy a $50 30gal aquarium, a sheet of glass that you can cut yourself, and create the same thing for close to $100?

The idea of small DIY projects for this aquarium makes sense to me, and just DIY projects in general. One of the "premier" makers of sumps seems to be [Trigger Systems](http://www.triggersys.com/). They offer sumps ranging from 30" - 36" long, with custom options. They include [specific dimensions](http://www.triggersys.com/sumps_detailed.html) for each of the individual sump sections, which is something I could essentially copy for my own sump. Once I get my stand in I can take more precise measurements to see what will fit, but I'm thinking something along the lines of their **RUBY30S** model would work well for me. 

{% blockquote %}
Dimensions: 30" long x 14" wide x 15" high 
Drain/Skimmer Section: 11" x 13.5" 
Center/Refugium Section: 9.5" x 13.5" 
Return Pump Section: 6" x 13.5" 
Total Water Volume: 25.0 gallons 
Operating Water Volume: 18.1 gallons* 
{% endblockquote %}

My needs in a sump are fairly basic. I'd like a refugium section to eventually have - you guessed it, a refugium. A fairly large intake section where my skimmer will sit, and a smaller return section where my in-sump pump will go. Based on the size of the [Reef Octopus](http://www.amazon.com/Reef-Octopus-Needle-Wheel-Skimmer/dp/B003TQ9ST6) skimmer that I'd like to get, the first section would need to be a little bit larger - maybe another inch or so for some breathing room. 

I'm pretty excited about building my own sump. I need to nail down a couple of other pieces before I start designing - mainly the the skimmer and return pump. More to come!
