So a couple of weeks ago I made the decision to start a salt-water aquarium. Let me begin by saying that I knew **absolutely nothing** about salt water aquariums when I made this decision. I've always been intrigued by the beauty of salt water fish and coral. What I have learned over the past 2 weeks has been quite astonishing. People in this hobby are *intense* about their craft - and are willing to spend absurd amounts of money to get what they want. 

That's another thing. This is not a cheap hobby in any sense of the word. There are ways of doing it on the cheap, and they definitely work - but could end up giving you problems at the end of the day. Luckily for a noob like myself, there are a ton of great resources out on the interwebs. I've also had a few friends that have ventured into the salt water aquarium world, which always helps. 

I've already got a start on a few peices of equipment for the tank. **Equipment I have so far:**

- 75 gallon aquarium with stand.
- [EHEIM Jager Aquarium Thermostat Heater 300W](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I5UC0W/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00)
- 2 x [Koralia Evolution Aquarium Pump (1400gph)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036S1ETY/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00)
- [Glass-holes.com 700gph Overflow Kit](http://www.glass-holes.com/700-gph-Overflow-Box-Complete-Kit-gh700kit.htm)
- [Glass-holes.com 3/4" Inch Loc-Line Return Kit](http://www.glass-holes.com/3-4-Inch-Loc-Line-Return-Kit-ghReturn75.htm)
- 60lb bucket of Instant Ocean salt.
- [Refractometer RF15](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H7ILCW/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00)

**Equipment that I still need**:

- Protein Skimmer
- Sump
	- I'm deciding if I want to build a custom sump or not. It would be a cool DIY project, and save a lot of money versus buying something premade
- Substrate
	- Argonite, at least 75lbs.
- Live Rock
	- Not sure of the type right now, but at least 75lbs.
- Lighting 
	- From what I understand, I won't really need lights until after my tank is completely cycled. Thinking LEDs here - but god damn they are expensive. 
- RO/DI water
- In-Sump Return Pump

End of the day, I still need a lot of stuff just to get a functioning tank up and running. Not even thinking about fish/coral at this point. More posts coming!
