Yesterday night I finished painting the back side of the tank. I went with a matte black, only because I'm not a fan of the glossy paints and I think it would look a little cheesy under heavy lighting. I see a lot of people doing blue, or other "wallpaper" sort of effects, and in my opinion they just end of looking cheesy. You can't go wrong with black in my book.

The paint I decided to go with was a spray paint. I debated using a brush, but from previous experiences from painting on glass, I knew that it's sort of difficult. Brushes tend to leave streaks because the paint doesn't really adhere to the glass that well. If you do decide to paint with spray paint, a couple tips:

<!--more-->

- Light coats. I did about 6 light coats over the course of several hours. The first coat barely sticks, the rest go on easier. 
- Don't forget to mask/block off the inside of the tank with paper towels (or something). Spray paint has a tendency to make particles that get everywhere.
- Clearly we're painting the outside here. **Never** paint inside the tank where your water could have contact with it. 

Overall, I think it turned out great. Here's a picture just after the last coat went on: (No masking, I was just doing the edges)

I went a little heavier around the edges, because that's where most of the light could bleed through. I tested the overall coverage with an LED flashlight from the inside, and nothing came through. 

I will post some more pictures when it's back upstairs and on the tank stand - hopefully tomorrow!
